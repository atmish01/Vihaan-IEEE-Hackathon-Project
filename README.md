# BharatKaHunar 
An e-commerce platform for traditional small scale businesses and SHGs of women from all regions of India to sell authentic and indigenous goods and artifacts.

### Problem Statement:
E-commerce giants like Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra etc display goods and products from various big brands at the same time, small businesses are not able to get the most out of it because of lack of the brand name, less money, and marketing skills.
* Poverty, illiteracy and lack of resources in rural India - hence linking with an easy-to-understand system, with videos, images and step-by-step instructions for selling the product from scratch.
* Lack of understanding of marketing
* Low product reach

### Proposed Solution:
We have ideated to build an e-commerce website specifically for self help groups and other small scale businesses run in rural India, especially by women.
This will solve the problem of product visibility of products on ecommerce sites as bigger brands will not be able to monopolize the space. <br>
We propose to create a platform where people with lesser awareness, low funds and less experience in marketing can sell their products, be it home-made sweets, artworks and other traditional products or services, and increase their reach. <br>
Such businesses create lower amount of goods, hence, they can offer customisation and personalisation. <br>
We also classify the goods on the basis of region to increase visibility of niche products.

### USPs of the Project:
* Helps small businesses increase the visibility of their products and services.
* Skill development through specific portals.
* Provides customisation on products.
* Segregation of products on the basis of region to promote lesser known products and provide variety to customers.

### Future Scope
* The DAY-NULM  program introduced by the government teaches SHGs (Self Help Groups - groups of local women from rural areas) to sell their goods and services online, where their products werenâ€™t being sold at a faster rate. 
* We realised that this problem could be solved with the help of our website, our model could be integrated with their data and their goods could be sold on our website with customizable data items and their information.
* We can integrate Speech to Text Recognition feature to benefit rural people, who are not well versed with tech, in searching and uploading their products.
